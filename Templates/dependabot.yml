# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates

## Example below:
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # See documentation for possible values
    directory: "/api" # Location of package manifests
    target-branch: "dev"
    versioning-strategy: increase-if-necessary
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    allow:
      # Allow both direct and indirect updates for all packages
      - dependency-type: "all"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "npm api prod"
      prefix-development: "npm api dev"
      include: "scope"
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # See documentation for possible values
    directory: "/client" # Location of package manifests
    target-branch: "dev"
    versioning-strategy: increase-if-necessary
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    allow:
      # Allow both direct and indirect updates for all packages
      - dependency-type: "all"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "npm client prod"
      prefix-development: "npm client dev"
      include: "scope"
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # See documentation for possible values
    directory: "/" # Location of package manifests
    target-branch: "dev"
    versioning-strategy: increase-if-necessary
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    allow:
      # Allow both direct and indirect updates for all packages
      - dependency-type: "all"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "npm all prod"
      prefix-development: "npm all dev"
